# GA-Card-Problem
Genetic algorithm (GA) implementation to split a deck of cards [1..10] in two such that one pile sums to 36 and the other multiplies to 360.<br />

Example of global best solution:<br />
Pile1: sum([2, 7, 8, 9, 10]) = 36<br />
Pile2: prod([1, 3, 4, 5, 6]) = 360<br />

Run problem.py to use GA to find a solution to the problem over many generations. <br />
Parameters can be tuned in ga.py. <br />
